ejabberd (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Calling convention of the ejabberdctl program was changed.
  Also some of its commands were renamed or removed,
  or their calling convention was changed due to switching
  to another ejabberd module providing a set of additional commands.

  "sasl.log" was renamed to "erlang.log", and ejabberd command-line option
  to change its location was renamed accordingly as well.

  See the "Upgrading from 2.0.x series" section in README.Debian for details.
