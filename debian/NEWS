ejabberd (2.1.0rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Calling convention of the ejabberdctl program was changed.
  Also some of its commands were renamed or removed,
  or their calling convention was changed due to switching
  to another ejabberd module providing a set of additional commands.
  See README.Debian for details.
