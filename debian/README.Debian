This package tries to backup the old ejabberd database if upgraded from
0.7.5 to 0.9 because the new format is incompatible to the old one. The
backup can be found at /var/lib/ejabberd.bak .

IMPORTANT: do not forget to update the 'host' configuration to 'hosts'
in /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg when upgrading from version 0.7.5.
