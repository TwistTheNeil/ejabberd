* Use upstream ejabberdctl.cfg as /etc/default/ejabberd.
  Requires patching, see the master branch.
  Also ensure that the config is safe w.r.t. proxy65 etc,
  def. log level match etc (compate to the current one).

* Re-check whether the upstream startup files would do
  better than current.
  The current have some nice ideas but they
  a) deviate from upstream
  b) artifically constructing node names for ejabberdctl
     provokes the atom list overflow of the ejabberd host
     in certain scenarious; no robust workaround is known yet.

* Update README.Debian:
  o Restructure, add headings and leading TOC.
  o A note on database drivers.
  o A note on epam binary permissions and stat-override.

* Write the NEWS file:
  o Mention ejabberdctl commands that were renamed.
  o sasl.log rename.
  o Mnesia spool reloaction (check first).

* Update ejabberdctl.8 to match the recent ejabberdctl.

* Why do we suggest libunix-syslog-perl?


Low priority
============

* Write PID file by default, create /var/run/ejabberd.

* Think of supporting the "live" rc-file target
  to deviate from upstream a bit less (this actually
  should be an argument to ejabberd script).

* Do we need the separate ejabberd script at all?
